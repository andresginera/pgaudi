Quick usage
===========

For running GAUDI jobs you only need to execute the command ``pgaudi``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pgaudi path/to/some_file.gaudi-input

The input files needed are the same as the GaudiMM's input files. To learn
how to create them follow the `tutorial <https://gaudi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input.html#input>`_ of the GaudiMM's documentation.

For visualize the output file you can simply use the command ``gaudi view`` and visualize the solutions with `GaudiView <https://github.com/insilichem/gaudiview>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ gaudi view path/to/some_file.gaudi-output
